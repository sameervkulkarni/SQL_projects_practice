# SQL Projects Practice ðŸš€

A collection of hands-on SQL projects designed to strengthen querying, data modeling, and analysis skills using real-world-style databases.

## Overview

This repository features a curated set of SQL exercises and mini-projects that cover:

* **Relational schema design**
* Complex joins, groupings, aggregates
* Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Window functions and ranking
* Data cleaning with SQL
* Performance optimization and indexing strategies
* Integration scenarios (if using db clients or scripting)

Each project typically includes:

* A project folder with `.sql` files
* `README.md` explaining context, schema, and objectives
* Sample data or generation scripts (e.g., `.csv`, `.sql` inserts)
* Optional walkthrough or notes

## Projects Included

* **\[Project1]**: Describe dataset/domain and skills demonstrated (e.g., sales analyticsâ€”CTEs, window functions)
* **\[Project2]**: Describe scenario (e.g., customer segmentationâ€”joins, subqueries)
* *(Add your list)*

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sameervkulkarni/SQL_projects_practice.git
   cd SQL_projects_practice
   ```

2. **Choose a project folder** and inspect its `README.md` for dataset context and exercise goals.

3. **Load sample data** into your SQL environment using provided SQL scripts or import CSV files.

4. **Run and modify `.sql` files**, compare your solutions, experiment further.

## Recommended Tools

* **Database engines**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite (adjust `schema.sql` if needed)
* **Clients**: DBeaver, pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench, DataGrip, SQLite CLI
* **Scripting for automation** (optional): Python + SQLAlchemy, Node.js + knex, etc.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome!

* Fork the repo
* Create a folder for a new project (e.g., `Project3_NewDataset/`)
* Add `schema.sql`, `queries.sql`, and detailed `README.md`
* Sample data files included
* Send a PR with your new project

## Learning Outcomes

By completing these projects, youâ€™ll be able to:

* Design clean, normalized schemas
* Write efficient queries with advanced SQL concepts
* Understand query execution and optimization
* Apply SQL to real-world analytic and reporting problems

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

* Add data for additional domains (e.g., healthcare, finance)
* Include database-specific tuning exercise (e.g., indexing strategy)
* Provide Python/R notebooks demonstrating full ETL workflow
* Create a summary report or dashboard on project outcomes

If you need feedback or guidance on any project, feel free to open an issue!
